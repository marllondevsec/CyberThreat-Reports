This repository contains technical malware analysis reports, focusing on reverse engineering, runtime behavior, evasion techniques, C2 infrastructure, and attack chains.

The goal is to document real-world samples, share practical cybersecurity knowledge, and serve as a reference for analysts, researchers, and incident response teams.

No binary malware samples are stored in this repository — only technical documentation, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and detection artifacts.
